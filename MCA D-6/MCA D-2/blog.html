                <p>Coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world after oil. In 2024, the global market value exceeded $130 billion, with an estimated growth of over $175 billion by 2030. About 3 billion cups are consumed every day, a sign of an industry that impacts millions of people: from growers in tropical countries to roasters, up to baristas and end consumers..</p>

                    <strong>India’s Coffee Culture Boom</strong>India’s economic ascent, coupled with a swelling middle-class consumer base, has made emerging markets such as coffee cafés increasingly appealing to businesses. The Indian middle class, influenced by western trends and with an augmented living standard, perceives coffee more as a symbol of affluence than just a beverage. This paradigm shift in perception has made freshly ground coffee, usually enjoyed outside of home premises, a popular choice among many.</p>
                <p>A significant factor driving this change is the ‘third-wave coffee experience.’ By highlighting the handcrafted essence of coffee, from roasting to brewing, coffee shops in India have familiarized customers with specialty coffee, enhancing the overall experience.</p>
                <p>Reflecting on the past decade, the coffee culture in India has evolved dramatically. While the south has a longstanding tradition of filter coffee, the north primarily relished instant variants. Fast forward to today, specialty coffee has extended its reach throughout the nation. With India’s socio-economic growth, the demand for better consumer goods, including coffee, has shot up.</p>
